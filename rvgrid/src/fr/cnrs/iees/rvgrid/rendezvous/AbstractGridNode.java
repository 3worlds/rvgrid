/**
 * <p>Implementation of {@link GridNode}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Instances of this class can exchange {@link RVMessage} at rendezvous and execute a 
 * {@link RendezvousProcess} matching the message type.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Instances of this class register types of messages matching particular actions 
 * (= instances of {@link RendezvousProcess}) through the {@code addRendezvous} method. 
 * These types are those that this instance are able
 * to process.</p>
 * <p>Whenever a message is received (through a call to the {@code callRendezvous} method), it is 
 * checked against message types: if the type is already registered, the matching {@code RendezvousProcess}
 * is executed; if not, the message is put in a queue for possible later registering of this message
 * type. The next time  {@code addRendezvous} is called, it will attempt to process all messages
 * contained in the queue.
 * </p>
 * <p>Of course one should be careful to always call {@code callRendezvous} with a message type
 * that is or will be registered with this instance; otherwise messages can pile up indefinitely.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This class should be overriden by specialised descendants for any particular implementation
 * of the {@link fr.cnrs.iees.rvgrid.rendezvous rendezvous pattern}.</p>
